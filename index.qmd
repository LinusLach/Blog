## Hello!
I'm Linus. Math graduate from [UUlm](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/mawi/mathematics-and-economics/) who is currently
pursuing a PhD in Statistics at [UNIA](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/wiwi/prof/stat/okhrin/team/linus-lach/) and have
an interest in stochastics, statistics, and optimization with an application in economics and computer science.

I mainly code with R and Python, but also use other tools like SQL, MongoDB, HTML and JS to help me with my projects.

My current plan is to write a few smaller blog posts on topics I learned about in different courses and extend on them
by adding a more context or illustrations in order to reach a broader audience.
